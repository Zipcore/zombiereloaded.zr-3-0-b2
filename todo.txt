Section content is listed in order of importance. Some of these can be ideas too.

---- CRITICAL/IMPORTANT ----


---- NORMAL/GAMEPLAY ----

* Fix ambience not always playing: separate timers for each player.

* Fix zvision not disabled if the class value is blank. Improve ZVision function,
  use strlen instead of checking the first character. Also check the main CVAR.

* Make admin commands to get or set classes:
  zr_classes_set <classname> <target>
  zr_classes_get <#userid|name>

* Make it possible to disable certain classes on certain maps. Only specify the
  class name to read the value:
  zr_class_enabled <classname>[ <0/1>]

* Super features for both zombies and humans:
  - Humans: No fall damage for X seconds. X limits per round.
  - Zombies: No knockback/damage for X seconds. X limits per round.

* Make a admin command to read and write settings to a spesific class,
  using key/value. Integrate it with the zr_admin menu.

* Knockback presets (integrated into zombie admin menu).
  Temporary do many changes on the zombies (by executing configs). Useful
  settings or fun settings. SourceMod already has a execute config menu, but it
  would be better if this was integrated in ZR.

* zombie.inc:KnockBack / cvars.inc
  Make a CVAR for adjusting shotgun/hegrenade knockback boost.

* Validate ALL configs and cvars while loading the plugin. Log messages and unload ZR (or use default) if invalid data is found.

* Make a jetpack feature.

* Fix some zombies not able to zombify some humans when using the infect
  command before the first zombie. (make him a mother zombie, kill infect timer,
  set some switches)
