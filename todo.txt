Section content is listed in order of importance. Some of these can be ideas too.

---- CRITICAL/IMPORTANT ----

* When you turn off zvision it's remembered to next time you get zombified, but
  not the nightvision. Make it remember the last nvgs state as zombie too.
  Got some complains and it's a bit annoying too. Should be an easy fix.

* FIXED  --  fix spawn protection
  players gets invisible, but not protected against zombies.
  the array pProtect isn't used at all, just set to off and on.

* DONE  --  classes.inc:GetClassKnockback
  change class knockback to be a miltiplier of the default knockback (like the
  old ZR), not absolute values:
  knockback = default * class knockback


---- NORMAL/GAMEPLAY ----

* Make a gloval CVAR for setting default zombie. Must work with per-map configs.

* Make it possible to disable certain classes on certain maps.

* Make a function for overriding class knockback (and maybe other settings too),
  by directly modifying class data in the array after the classes are loaded.
  To be used on per map configs.

  SetClassKnockback(classname, data)
  zr_class_knockback classname data
  This one is a bit important because the maps can be better balanced by adjusting a single zombie class.

* Zombie dont have fall damage (damage by player 0 = server should always work)
  Make it a CVAR, so for example zombies can't kill themselfs on same maps by
  going through lasers.

* zombie.inc:KnockBack / cvars.inc
  Make a CVAR for setting shotgun/hegrenade knockback boost. The zombies don't
  fly away that much.
