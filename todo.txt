Section content is listed in order of importance. Some of these can be ideas too.

---- CRITICAL/IMPORTANT ----

* FIXED  --  fix spawn protection
  players gets invisible, but not protected against zombies.
  the array pProtect isn't used at all, just set to off and on.

* DONE  --  classes.inc:GetClassKnockback
  change class knockback to be a multiplier of the default knockback (like the
  old ZR), not absolute values:
  knockback = default * class knockback


---- NORMAL/GAMEPLAY ----

* Fix class data not reloaded on map change. Custom class data from previous map is not reset.

* Make it possible to disable certain classes on certain maps.
  Admin command: zr_class_enabled <class name> <0/1>

* Make a more advanced teleporter:
  - Admin command: zr_teleport <player>
  - Separate teleport limits for both teams
  - Separate delays for both teams
  - Startup time
  - Separate cooldown for both teams
  - Maybe some teleportation effects, like sound, glow or smoke.
  (make a separate inc-file for the teleporter)

* Make a admin command to read and write settings to a spesific class, using key/value.
  Integrate it with the zr_admin menu.

* Zombie dont have fall damage (damage by player 0 = server should always work)
  Make it a CVAR, so for example zombies can't kill themselfs on some maps by
  going through lasers.

* zombie.inc:KnockBack / cvars.inc
  Make a CVAR for setting shotgun/hegrenade knockback boost. The zombies don't
  fly away that much.

* Fix some zombies not able to zombify some humans when using the infect command
  before the first zombie. (make him a mother zombie, kill infect timer, set some
  switches)
