Section content is listed in order of importance. Some of these can be ideas too.

---- CRITICAL/IMPORTANT ----

* Logging of infections by admins. For monitoring.

---- NORMAL/GAMEPLAY ----

* Make it possible to disable certain classes on certain maps. Only specify the
  class name to read the value:
  zr_class_enabled <classname>[ <0/1>]

* Zombies that dies from anything else than a human attack (+ grenades) will respawn as zombies.

* Make a admin command to read and write settings to a spesific class,
  using key/value. Integrate it with the zr_admin menu.

* Zombie dont have fall damage (damage by player 0 = server should always work)
  Make it a CVAR, so for example zombies can't kill themselfs on some maps by
  going through lasers.

* Knockback presets (integrated into zombie admin menu).
  Temporary do many changes on the zombies (by executing configs). Useful
  settings or fun settings. SourceMod already has a execute config menu, but it
  would be better if this was integrated in ZR.

* zombie.inc:KnockBack / cvars.inc
  Make a CVAR for adjusting shotgun/hegrenade knockback boost.

* Validate ALL configs and cvars while loading the plugin. Log messages and unload ZR (or use default) if invalid data is found.

* Make a jetpack feature.

* Fix some zombies not able to zombify some humans when using the infect
  command before the first zombie. (make him a mother zombie, kill infect timer,
  set some switches)
