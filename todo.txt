Section content is listed in order of importance. Some of these can be ideas too.

---- CRITICAL/IMPORTANT ----


---- NORMAL/GAMEPLAY ----

* Make it possible to disable certain classes on certain maps. Only specify the
  class name to read the value:
  zr_class_enabled <classname>[ <0/1>]

* Make a admin command to read and write settings to a spesific class,
  using key/value. Integrate it with the zr_admin menu.

* Make a more advanced teleporter:
  - Admin command: zr_teleport <player>
  - Separate teleport limits for both teams
  - Separate delays for both teams
  - Startup time
  - Separate cooldown for both teams
  - Maybe some teleportation effects, like sound, glow or smoke.
  (make a separate inc-file for the teleporter)

* Zombie dont have fall damage (damage by player 0 = server should always work)
  Make it a CVAR, so for example zombies can't kill themselfs on some maps by
  going through lasers.

* Knockback presets (integrated into zombie admin menu).
  Temporary do many changes on the zombies (by executing configs). Useful
  settings or fun settings. SourceMod already has a execute config menu, but it
  would be better if this was integrated in ZR.

* zombie.inc:KnockBack / cvars.inc
  Make a CVAR for adjusting shotgun/hegrenade knockback boost.

* Make a jetpack feature.

* Fix some zombies not able to zombify some humans when using the infect
  command before the first zombie. (make him a mother zombie, kill infect timer,
  set some switches)
