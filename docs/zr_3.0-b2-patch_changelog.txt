  for more information about the class speed attribute.
  Important: Class speeds and spawn protection speed must be updated! Use this conversion formula:
      prop speed offset = ((lmv speed / 300) * 250) - 250
  If you don't want to update speed values right now, use "zr_classes_speed_method lmv" in
  zombiereloaded.cfg for backwards compatibility.
* Added 'explode' suicide command from OB update to intercept list (bug 190).

* Fixed a rare case where removing weapons didn't work.
* Possibly fixed invalid handle error with WeaponsEntityToDisplay (bug 163).

  reading bits from a number.
