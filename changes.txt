Changes from Zombie: Reloaded 2.5.1
====================================

Alpha values (transparency)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for alpha values in classes. New values in classes.txt (per class):

  Key:           Value:    Default:    Description:
  alpha_spawn    <0-255>   255         initial alpha value (0 = transparent)
  alpha_damaged  <0-255>   255         alpha value when damaged
  alpha_damage   <damage>  0           how much damage to do before
                                       alpha_damaged take effect

Knockback multiplier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If classes are enabled the zr_zombie_knockback cvar is used as a multiplier.
Makes it possible to set custom knockback on maps using per-map configs.

Set zr_zombie_knockback to 1 if you use classes and want it the way it was
before.

  knockback = zr_zombie_knockback * class knockback

Full spawn protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spawn protection makes the players invisible and move faster, and cannot be
infected during protection time.

A centered counter shows the time remaining.

Overriding class night vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for overrriding class nvgs with the zr_zombie_nvgs cvar. Generally,
any non-zero value is considered as on.

  Value:    Description:
  -1        no override (use value in classes.txt) / nvgs on
  0         never give nvgs
  1         always give nvgs

Anticamp feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define hurt volumes in maps that gives x damage at a custom interval.

When creating volumes they should start a little bit _below_ the floor, so it
covers the players feet.

The volume is rectangular and you only need two locations in the map to create
it; a top corner, and the bottom corner at the oposite side.

  zr_anticamp_create_volume <damage> <interval> <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
    - Create a rectangular volume between the specified locations.
  
  zr_anticamp_remove_volume <volume id>
    - Remove a volume.
  
  zr_anticamp_list
    - List existing volumes.

Set default classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting the default class with a cvar. Works with per-map configs.
  
  zr_classes_default <classname>

Zombie admin menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic zombie admin commands like adjusting knockback, nvgs, infecting players
and spawn everyone.

Knockback changes are applied instantly, useful for tuning knockback in-game.

Note that the changes are not saved. They will reset on map change. In a
future version this menu might save the changes.

  Knockback multiplier
    - Fine tune the knockback multiplier.
  
  Class knockback
    - Fine tune a class knockback value.
  
  Night vision settings
    - Override night vision settings (explained earlier).
  
  Infect
    - Infect a player. Lists all players, but could be changed to only list
      humans.
  
  Spawn players
    - Spawns all dead players (except spectactors).
  
  (more zombie admin stuff might come...)

Set (and get) class knockback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set or get knockback from a class. Changes are not saved. They will be reset on
map change.
  
  zr_set_class_knockback <classname> <knockback>
    - Sets knockback to a specified class. Useful when using per-map configs to
      fine tune the class knockback for a map.
  
  zr_get_class_knockback <classname>
    - Prints the current knockback of a class to the client/server console.
      Using the zombie admin menu to read a knockback value is easier sometimes.
