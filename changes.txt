Behaviour changes from version 2.5.1
=====================================

* Support for alpha values in classes. New values in classes.txt (per class):
  
    Key:           Value:    Default:    Description:
    alpha_spawn    <0-255>   255         initial alpha value (0 = transparent)
    alpha_damaged  <0-255>   255         alpha value when damaged
    alpha_damage   <damage>  0           how much damage to do before
                                         alpha_damaged take effect

* If classes are enabled the zr_zombie_knockback cvar is used as a multiplier.
  Makes it possible to set custom knockback on maps using per-map configs. Set
  zr_zombie_knockback to 1 if you use classes and want it the way it was before.
  
    knockback = zr_zombie_knockback * class knockback

* Spawn protection makes the players invisible and move faster, and cannot be
  infected during protecting time. A centered counter shows the time remaining.

* Support for overrriding class nvgs with the zr_zombie_nvgs cvar:
  Generally, any non-zero value is considered as on.
  
    Value:    Description:
    -1        no override (use value in classes.txt) / nvgs on
    0         never give nvgs
    1         always give nvgs

* Setting default class with a cvar. Works with per-map configs.
  
    zr_classes_default <classname>

* Zombie admin menu. Basic zombie admin commands like adjusting knockback, nvgs,
  infecting players and spawn everyone. Knockback changes are applied instantly,
  useful for fine tuning live. Note that the changes are not saved. They will be
  reset on map change. In the future this menu might save the changes.
  
    Knockback multiplier
      - Fine tune the knockback multiplier.
    
    Class knockback
      - Fine tune a class knockback value.
    
    Night vision settings
      - Override night vision settings (explained earlier).
    
    Infect
      - Infect a player. Lists all players, but could be changed to only list
        humans.
    
    Spawn players
      - Spawns all dead players (except spectactors).
    
    (more zombie admin stuff might come...)

* Console commands zr_set_class_knockback and zr_get_class_knockback. Changes
  are not saved. They will be reset on map change.
  
  zr_set_class_knockback <classname> <knockback>
    - Sets knockback to a specified class. Useful when using per-map configs to
      fine tune the class knockback for a map.
  
  zr_get_class_knockback <classname>
    - Prints the current knockback of a class to the client/server console.
      Using the zombie admin menu to read a knockback value is easier sometimes.

* Other minior and major bug fixes. See changelog.txt.
