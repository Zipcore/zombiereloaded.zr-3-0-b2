Compiling:

- Windows: Use compile.bat in the source code repository.
- Linux: Use the makefile.

The binary will be made in <repos>/build.

The develop environment should be mostly stand-alone with SourcePawn compiler
some tools and include files. But there are some other stuff that's required
for this to work:

Linux users:
- Mercurial
- Make

Windows users:
- TortoiseHG (windows version of Mercurial, with both GUI and command line
  tools).
