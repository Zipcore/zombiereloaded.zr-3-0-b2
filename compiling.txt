This plugin has a command for dumping detailed version info (zr_version) based
on info from a automatically generated file (hgversion.h.inc).

There's a script that generate this file and must be executed every time before
compiling:

    updateversion.sh
    updateversion.bat (Executes updateversion.sh using Cygwin)

Mercurial (or TortoiseHG) must be installed for this script to work. Use the
makefile to compile since that one will do most of the work. Make sure you
clean any existing builds before compiling:

    make clean
    make

For compiling on windows, run:

    compile.bat

If you don't have Mercurial, there's an option to disable this feature. In
zombiereloaded.sp there's a line like this:

    #define ADD_VERSION_INFO 1

To disable it, comment that line like this:

    //#define ADD_VERSION_INFO 1

Then you should be able to compile without hgversion.h.inc.
