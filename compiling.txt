This plugin has a command for dumping detailed version info (zr_version) based
on info from a automatically generated file (hgversion.h.inc).

There's a script that generate this file and must be executed every time before
compiling. Currently there's only a linux version of that script:

    updateversion.sh

Mercurial must be installed for this script to work. Use the makefile to
compile since that one will do most of the work. Make sure you clean any
existing builds before compiling:

    make clean
    make

If you're compiling on windows, there's an option to disable this feature. In
zombiereloaded.sp there's a line like this:

    #define ADD_VERSION_INFO 1

To disable it, comment that line like this:

    //#define ADD_VERSION_INFO 1

Then you should be able to compile without hgversion.h.inc.
